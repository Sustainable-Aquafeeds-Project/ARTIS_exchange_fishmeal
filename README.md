# ARTIS_exchange_fmfo

This repository is to start exploring the ARTIS Aquatic Resource Trade in Species database and their API, to begin work on our proposed project entitled "Resolving Trade Patterns of Seafood Byproducts for fishmeal in the ARTIS Database".

In this project we aim to answer the question "Can we trace seafood byproducts used for fishmeal to their origins using ARTIS trade data?"

Goals for the ARTIS Exchange Hackathon: 
 - Adjust ARTIS fish meal trade data to incorporate marine ingredients from trimmings: 
     - Examine current trade patterns of fishmeal and use methodology developed by the Sustainable Aquafeeds Project (https://sustainableaquafeedsproject.org/) to determine the flow of trimmed resources used for marine ingredients into the ARTIS database.

Long term goals: 
 - Derive the provenance of fish oil from trimmed resources by back calculating from fishmeal production in the ARTIS database. 
 - Quantify the environmental pressures and impacts from trimmed resource use. 
 - Identify drivers of trade: Investigate the factors influencing the trade of trimmed resources, including economic, regulatory, and environmental drivers.
 - Assess incentivizing strategies: Evaluate existing and potential incentives for responsible use of trimmed resources in marine ingredient production and global trade.
