<title>GLOBAL AQUATIC PROCESSED PRODUCTION STATISTICS - GENERAL NOTES</title> 
<header1> <h3>GLOBAL AQUATIC PROCESSED PRODUCTION STATISTICS 
  </h3></header1>
<body>
<p>This dataset presents statistics on world annual production of processed and preserved fishery and aquaculture products.</p>
<p>Data on the quantities are expressed in tonnes and refer to the net weight of the products. </p><p>
FAO's International Standard Statistical Classification of Fishery Commodities (ISSCFC), has been used for collation of detailed information on countries or zones. ISSCFC is an expansion of the 
United Nations Standard International Trade Classification, Revision 4 (SITC Rev.4) and is linked with the Harmonized System of the World Customs Organization. The commodity categories cover products 
derived from fish, crustaceans, molluscs and other aquatic animals and residues caught for commercial, industrial or subsistence uses, by all types of classes of fishing units operating in inland, fresh and brackish waters, 
in inshore, offshore or high seas fishing areas. Commodities produced from the raw materials supplied by all kinds of aquaculture are also included.
</p>
<p>
The World Sturgeon Conservation Society (WSCS) provided support on caviar data. 
The Marine Ingredients Organization (IFFO) provided support on fishmeal and fish oil data. 
</p>

<p>Where necessary, any data published in previous releases of this dataset have been revised. Where the figures in the current release differ from those previously published, the amended data represent the most recent version. 
Some statistics provided to FAO by national offices, in particular those for the last year, are provisional and may be amended in future editions.</p>

<head2> <h4>
COVERAGE OF STATISTICS ON PRODUCTION OF PROCESSED FISHERY AND AQUACULTURE PRODUCTS
</h4></head2>
The data cover the quantities of processed fishery and aquaculture products produced from:
<br><ol>
<br>a) nominal catches of all aquatic animals (except the catches of all aquatic mammals and the production of all aquatic plants) taken for commercial, industrial and subsistence purposes, by all types of fishing units operating in freshwater and marine areas;
<br>b) aquaculture production;
<br>c) imported raw materials.
</ol><p>The statistics include the output of processed products, produced on board factoryships and by fishers' families as domestic activities, e.g. drying, salting, smoking, etc.</p><p>
The statistics include also the processed products produced on board domestic fish factoryships and fishing craft from the reporting country or area, even when landed directly in foreign ports. However, data do not include processed products produced on board of foreign fish factoryships or fishing craft and landed directly in domestic ports.</p><p>
Statistics on the production of processed fishery and aquaculture products do not include quantities relative to &quot;Fish, live&quot;, &quot;Fish, fresh or chilled unprocessed&quot;, &quot;Live crustaceans&quot;, &quot;Live molluscs&quot;, &quot;Fresh unpeeled crustaceans&quot; and &quot;Fresh unshucked molluscs&quot;, as these items cannot be considered to be processed products.</p>
<head2> <h4>
NOTES ON COUNTRIES OR AREAS
</h4></head2>
The term country or area used covers territories, cities, land areas, as well as provinces, districts, enclaves, exclaves and other parts of territories or combinations of countries or areas such as 
economic or customs unions.<p>
Country or area names and designations are subject to nationally announced changes. Name changes announced after 31 December 2022 have not necessarily been incorporated in this dataset but will be reflected in future releases.</p><p>
Final data have been provided by many national offices; others submitted provisional figures only. Whenever national offices failed to report their annual statistics in time for publication, FAO, in the absence of other information, has generally used as production estimates the national figures available for the most recent years.</p><p>
Where national figures in this dataset differ from those previously released by FAO, the most recently published data represent the latest revisions.</p>
